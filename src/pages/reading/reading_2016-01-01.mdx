- Title: **The crack in space**
- Philip K Dick

My rating: ★★★★★

Did not want this book to end. Is more of a time travel novel than science fiction, definitely nods to The Time Machine. It draws on my (and probably everyone's) curiosity about the evolution of homosapiens—what we evolved to be, could have been, and other versions of humans we could have lived with.
