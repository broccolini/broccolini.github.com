- Title: **Broken Earth series**: The Fifth Season, The Obelisk Gate, and The Stone Sky
- Author: Nora K. Jemisin

My rating: ★★★★★ 

I was skeptical on whether I'd enjoy these books at first as they are more "fantasy" than I usually go for, I'm so glad I got over that as these books are an incredible gift to world. I read all three in a row and felt a little lost when I finished the last one in the series as I felt I'd been in that world for so long.
