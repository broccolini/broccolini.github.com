[![Illustration of women in space by Voila Vala](/reading/the-lady-astronaut.jpeg)](https://raw.abduzeedo.com/post/27409863297)

- Title: **The Calculating Stars** and **The Fated Sky** from The Lady Astronaut series
- Mary Robinette Kowal

My rating: ★★★★

Interesting take on alternative history if women had been in the first missions to the moon, and beyond. Probably would class as a "hard science fiction" novel as both books go into very detailed descriptions of planning and being on board space flight. I struggled to connect with the main character a bit, I think because of the time period. Otherwise really enjoyed the books.
