If you find yourself often having to ask two people "have you talked to each other yet?"â€”perhaps it's that they don't feel empowered to act, reach out, and make a decision... rather than not _thinking_ to "talk to each other" ðŸ¤”

Rather than assuming it's them, work towards having the answer be **yes**.
