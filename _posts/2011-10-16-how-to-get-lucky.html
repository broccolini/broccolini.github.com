		<p>These are my goals for the next year or so:</p>

		<ol>
		<li>work fucking hard</li>
		<li>find balance</li>
		<li>don't be a douchebag</li>
		</ol>

		<p>I haven't changed the world yet, but fuck yeah I'm here in San Francisco working as a UX designer. I'm probably in the best place in the world to be working in this industry right now and it's kind of amazing to me that it's me here doing this stuff. I'm not from here, I'm from the UK. I didn't do a degree, I wasn't top of my class, and I took a slight detour via Australia getting here.
		</p>
		<p>Since I got here and landed this sweet job people have said to me how lucky I am or how "wowed" they are by how quickly I went from wanting this to making it happen. I'm not lucky though and it's not THAT amazing that I am here. I just worked fucking hard and I made the most of opportunities that crossed my path. So I wanted to share things that help me get closer to where I want to be in life.
		</p>
		<h2>Setting goals</h2>
		<p>So many people bumble along not really working out for long periods of time what they want to do, which country to go travelling to, which gym to join so they get fit etc. The longer people don't decide the longer that thing doesn't happen, and all the other things that might be lining up behind it. I absolutely have those times too but I have them a lot less since I started making myself goals each year.
		</p>

		<p>Having this list of goals, a mantra or whatever, helps me focus my life and get closer to where I want to be. It's not necessarily so important whether they are exactly the right goals, it's more important that I continue to move forward. Sometimes I repeat them every day especially when I struggle with focus or motivation. I try and make sure everything, or at least a lot of what I do is about working towards them.
		</p>
		<p>I usually review my goals at the beginning of each year, but sometimes they are fuelled by major events in my life that make me take stock.
		</p>
		<p>I decided on my current list when I was back in Australia after  attending my visa interview and it had been approved. It was a huge event for me that reminded me how important focus and direction in my life is.
		</p>
		<p>I had shut everything trivial out for the last 5 months. This was the first chance I had to think about things further ahead. I could breathe again, take a moment to review where I was, how this changed things and what I wanted to do next. Everything working up to that point since March this year had been about getting that visa and getting back to San Francisco...  Which brings me to something else I find helps me keep moving forward.
		</p>

		<h2>Act on opportunity</h2>
		<p>Sometimes it's important to do something with a bit more urgency in your life. An opportunity may cross your path that requires a big decision or taking a bit of a risk, but you have a feeling you will hate yourself if you don't take it. You can't dilly dally about hesitating, you have to act immediately. When situations like that happen to me I forget everything else and focus on that one thing until I get it done. Moving to America was one of those things. 
		</p>
		<p>I travelled around the US for a month in March, and in the first week I got asked if I was interested in a job and moving to San Francisco. I hadn't really thought I would get offers for jobs while I was here and I had no idea how much I would love SF, but after 2 days I knew I wanted to move here. So from the minute I realized that was a possibility I focussed on nothing else until I made it happen. 
		</p>
		<p>It was exhausting. I was un-prepared for it. I had to put together a portfolio, write my CV (that probably no one read), attend a about one billion "chats" that increased in seriousness to actual interviews, do design "tests", and a whole bunch of other fun things. It required my total focus and meant not having quite so much fun on what I had intended to be a holiday. It was worth it though because now I am sat here in my apartment with shamazing views in San Francisco. I love my job and I'm doing a gazillion side projects, and meeting some of the most awesome people I've met it my life so far. 
		</p>
		<p>I did it. I got that shit done. FEELS GOOD MAN.
		</p>

		<h2>Create urgency just for the fuck of it</h2>
		<p>Now that I am living here and starting to find some normality, I have the challenge of tackling that stock pile of side projects I've put on hold since March. When things are more relaxed in my life, especially after such a crazy hectic period, it's sometimes hard to get back into that "get shit done mode".
		</p>

		<p>So when things are not so pressing or immediate but I know I need to make that thing happen I create myself a deadline. I make it a challenging deadline, not an easy one, so that I feel a little panicked that I might not make it. Basically I create urgency just for the fuck of it so that I sort of race myself to get that thing finished.</p>

		<p>The problem with side projects - that are not directly contributing to your career, that are not life threatening or things anyone will miss if you don't do them - is that they easily stay in that pile of not getting done. It's foolish to think it's not important to do them though. The strangest things lead to awesome opportunities and not doing them can mean they seriously pile up and begin to mock you. It can start to make you feel down.
		</p>
		<p>OctoTron was one of those things to me recently. I made myself stay up til 6.30am in the morning through ridiculous tiredness to finish it. I just needed to ship it and fuck I felt happy when I did. I started it months ago and with the craziness of moving countries and partying hard I just hadn't made the time to finish it. Now it glows at me gloriously as my iPad wallpaper and I was pretty chuffed when Cameron from GitHub tweeted it. 
		</p>
		<p>OctoTron won't change the world and noone would have cared if I hadn't done it, but I feel awesome having that one less thing on my side projects pile, and already it has lead to some interesting opportunities.
		</p>


		<h2>If today were the last day in my life</h2>
		<p>Two amazing people died recently: Steve Jobs and Oliver Schmelzle. You all know Steve and what a loss he was to the world. You might not know of Oliver, but to his family and friends and our company, he was of that same magnitude of loss.
		</p>
		<p>When people die it makes you reflective and take stock of your life and ask yourself if what you are doing is worthwhile. Steve Jobs said in his Stanford address that he used to look in the mirror every day and say <em>"If today were the last day in my life, would I do what I am about to do today?"</em>. I thought about that for a fair few days after he died, and again when Oliver died last week, and of course I want the answer to that question to be yes, but I choose to spend not too much time contemplating that thought and instead more time doing. 
		</p>
		<p>Not everything I do, maybe nothing, is about making this world a better place, changing an industry, or even a company. But I'm certainly not going to get anywhere near that if I don't start checking some things of my list. 
		</p>
		<p>Rather than worrying if everything I spend time doing will bring me fame and fortune or save the world, I just trust that it will teach me something that will be useful somewhere, and that it's better to be doing than thinking about doing.
		</p>
		<p>I wrote this to share what I do to help steer myself in the general direction of doing something worthwhile with my life. So for anyone who hasn't figured where or how to get there, perhaps set some goals, act on an opportunity that has crossed your path, or create urgency just for the fuck of it.
