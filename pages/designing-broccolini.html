<h1> {{ page.title }} </h1>
I decided I'd put off building a personal website for myself for far too long, so I gave myself one weekend to get it done.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>My goals were to have a site that:</p>
<ul class="points">
  <li>is simple to update that won't "get in the way" of me blogging</li>
  <li>allows me to focus on and practice my front-end skills</li>
  <li>has a visual style that reflects my personality</li>
  <li>promotes my professional work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>I wanted the design to be simple, that wouldn't take too long to create so that I could design and build it within the weekend, and that reflected my personality.</p>
<p>I decided to do some research and look at other sites that I wanted to be on a par with content wise, or that I liked the visual design of. I like typography and simple monotone colours, and I wanted the images on my site to be sketched - I sketch things all the time at work and for fun, so I felt it was an important to use sketches in my website design.</p>

<p>I looked at a few different sites but the following three sites influenced my website design the most.</p>

<img src="/images/portfolio/haskell.jpg">
<p class="caption">Hand drawn sketches on <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell</a></p>
<p>I had stumbled across <strong>Learn You a Haskell</strong> previously and I liked the cutsy style of the sketches.
</p>
<img src="/images/portfolio/fathom.jpg">
<p class="caption">Large typographic headings on <a href="http://fathom.info">Fathom.info</a></p>
<p>I came across the <strong>Fathom</strong> site as I have a love/hate relationship with infographics (i.e. I love good ones, hate bad ones - of which there are many!). I like the huge size of the heading, and I also like that the site is all greyscale.</p>

<img src="/images/portfolio/squaredeye.jpg">
<p class="caption">Monotone colours on <a href="http://squaredeye.com">squaredeye.com</a></p>
<p>The design of <strong>Squared Eye</strong> is busier than I wanted personally, but I like the pale colours, the illustrations and the textured feel.</p>

<p><strong>I started to look at fonts</strong> but found myself going down a rabbit hole. Seeing as I wanted to complete the project in a weekend I decided to keep it simple and stick with Courier and Helvetica for now.</p>

<p>I like sci-fi films and love drawing spaceships, aliens and robots, so as part of reflecting my personality I was keen to include the space fighter jets as part of my design. My website is very simple with large headings, but the fighter jets add a bit of fun and recognisable visual branding that I can apply to other collateral.</p>

<p>I went with very simple grey colours as I plan to include photos and colourful images in the future. I think this style will work as I develop my site and add more imagery in the content.</p>

<h2>Technical bits</h2>
<p><!-- I considered using Wordpress as I was familiar with it, but wasn't that excited about it seeing as I often find myself fidling with plugins to get it working how I want. I thought about learning Django for setting up a new blog as I'm familiar with using it at work but figured that would take me too long to setup.  -->I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> as it didn't require me to learn any programming, but I can still style as I like. It's really easy to install and I can use HTML, Markdown, or Textile for pages and blog posts. An added bonus is that I can host it on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> (as Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub pages) which means I can practice using Git which previously I was using very infrequently and thus forgetting commands.</p>

<h2>The end result</h2>
<p>I have a site that I designed and built and published live in a weekend. I am able to improve it easily bit by bit when I have time. Though it has a very simple minimal design, it still reflects my personality, and it's easy to maintain.</p>
