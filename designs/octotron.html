			<p>After seeing <a href="http://octodex.github.com/ironcat/">IronCat</a> way back in April this year I couldn't help but think what octocat I would make. I'd recently watched Tron and so naturally I had to make OctoTron.</p>

				<p>I decided to go with a version inspired by the first movie. It took me a while to finish with the small event of moving countries. But finally, here's <a href="/images/backgrounds/octotron.jpg">OctoTron</a>, now also proudly living on the <a href="http://octodex.github.com/octotron/">octodex</a>.</p>
			<p>You can also grab him from my <a href="https://github.com/broccolini/background_downloads/tree/master/downloads/github">backgrounds repo</a> for iPhone, iPad and desktop in a few variations. Enjoy. </p>
