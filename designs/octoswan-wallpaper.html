	  	<p>After making the <a href="/designs/github-black-swan-posters.html">GitHub "black swan" posters</a> I turned 2 of the designs into wallpaper for desktop and devices.</p>
		  <p>I made variations of the cream one into a faint grey background after a friend said he liked low contrast backgrounds. I then experimented and made myself a bright red version. I expected to find it too much, but I find the bright red color energetic and it helps make me feel motivated. I've totally fallen in love with it and have it on my iPhone too.</p>

			<p>I'm working on a few other backgrounds and I am working on a site to host them all so that's in the pipeline.</p>
