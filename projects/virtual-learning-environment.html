    <p>The <a href="#">Asia Pacific Forum</a> (APF) asked us to develop a Virtual Learning Environment for use by people learning how to setup and run human rights organisations.</p>
<h2>Project Goals and Stakeholders</h2>
<p>To kick off the project I ran a workshop with APF staff and trainers involved in the courses. During the workshop we explored project goals, key stakeholders, and developed persona journey's to look at user needs and motivations over time.</p>

<p><strong>The key stakeholders were</strong>:</p>
<ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Students</strong>: with english as a second language; using low speed internet connections with older versions of browsers; with varying computer and internet skills; and who are likely to have never participated in an online training course before</li>
  <li><strong>Trainers</strong>: with moderate technical skills, familiar with participating in online training courses; accessing from various locations and time zones</li>
  <li class="last"><strong>APF staff delivering the course</strong>: experienced with other virtual learning environments such as Moodle; moderate technical skills; most likely to setup courses.</li>
</ul.points>

<p>The goal of the project was to build a working prototype ready for use by trainers and students for a course starting in six weeks time.</p>

<p><strong>We agreed on the following release goals</strong></p>
<ul.points>
  <li>Intuitive and simple user interface over 'bells and whistles' design</li>
  <li>Less features built right rather than many features built below par</li>
  <li>Delivering on time over delivering features</li>
</ul>


<h2>Planning and specification</h2>
<p>One of the challenges of this project was that the APF project manager had little experience with website projects. We met to plan the first sprint but she found it difficult to understand what were building. So we captured high level priorities and then agreed to develop basic wireframes and come back and prioritise features based around components of the site such as discussion and assignments.</p>

<p>I met with the designer and programmer and discussed and sketched out our ideas about the design of the interface so that we could work through the features quickly together. These sketches informed the development of the wireframes.</p>

<p>I kept the wireframes quite simple as we had limited budget to do detailed documentation, but with enough detail to allow us to discuss features during sprint planning.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<p>The production phase was split into 2 sprints so that we could include some user testing with APF staff and trainers before completing development. This helped us prioritise what was essential for the release. Design started slightly ahead of development, once the core styles had been set the rest of the design was done in the browser rather than continuing with photoshop flats. The team worked closely together during production so that we could discuss detail and make quick decisions.</p>

<p>The end result was an application that was easily to use with robust features and a simple clear design.</p>

<p>APF were happy with the result and claimed they had a much higher retention with their students than previous online courses. They approached us to develop the application further which is currently under development.</p>
