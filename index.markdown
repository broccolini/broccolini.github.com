I am English but with an aussie twang after living in Australia long enough to become a citizen. After a [life-changing experience on the Startupbus](https://medium.com/road-trips/34b7feabb86f) in 2011, I moved to SF where I can comfortably sit working on my laptop while drinking excellent coffee. I now design things at [Snapguide](http://snapguide.com).

Check out my [Portfolio](http://portfolio.broccolini.net) for work samples, see [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/broccolini) for small snippets of design, or find me as [broccolini](http://twitter.com/broccolini/) in most places on the internet.
