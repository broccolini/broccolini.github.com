I am English but with an aussie twang after living in Australia long enough to become a citizen. After a [life-changing experience on the Startupbus](https://medium.com/road-trips/34b7feabb86f) in 2011, I moved to SF to work for [Vast](http://www.vast.com/) and then [Snapguide](http://snapguide.com/). Towards the end of 2013 I made the move to New York for new adventures, proudly joining the product design team at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/).

Check out my [Portfolio](http://portfolio.broccolini.net) for work samples, see [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/broccolini) for small snippets of design, or find me as [broccolini](http://twitter.com/broccolini/) in most places on the internet.
