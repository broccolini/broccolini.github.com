    <p><strong>Hello, I'm Diana Mounter.</strong></p>
	<p>I design user experiences and help teams build them. My approach is influenced by human-centric design, agile development, the people I work with, and the lessons I learn from each project.</p>
    </div><!-- End columnB -->
    
       <div class="columnA">
        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>I sketch, illustrate, and craft designs in Photoshop and Illustrator for websites and printed things.</p>
        </div><!-- End columnA -->

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h2>GitHub "black swan" posters</h2>
              <p>I wanted to stretch my Illustrator skills so I created myself a project, which was to design a poster for GitHub as if it were a film in the style of the <a href="http://www.annihall.com/beautyblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/FI_BLACKSWAN_posters4.jpeg">Black Swan movie posters</a> using the <a href="http://octodex.github.com/">GitHub Octocat</a> as the main visual feature.</p>

              <a class="img" href="/images/portfolio/github-poster2.png"><img class="thumb" src="/images/portfolio/github-poster2-thumb.png"></a>
              <a class="img" href="/images/portfolio/github-poster3.png"><img src="/images/portfolio/github-poster3-thumb.png"></a>          
              <p>I didn't have an EPS file of the original Octocat so I had to trace the different versions from images I found on the web - apologies for any inaccuracies!</p>
              </li>        
            <li>
              <h2>Stick Party</h2>
              <p>The Stick Party site was for advertising a web app that a friend of mine was building. He wanted it to be a fun design and liked the hand-drawn sketched look.</p>
              <a class="img" href="/images/portfolio/stickparty.png"><img src="/images/portfolio/stickparty-thumb.png"></a>
              <p>I created "Mr Stick" which I think help achieved the fun feel.</p>
              </li>

            <li>
              <h2>Eco2labs</h2>
              <p>This website design was for a startup I was working with that was building a database and web applications on the sustainability of products. The aims of the site were to encourage people to sign up and get involved, and provide basic information to potential business partners and clients.</p>
              <a class="img" href="/images/portfolio/eco2labs.png"><img src="/images/portfolio/eco2labs-thumb.png"></a>
              <p>There was no branding established and the exact direction for the business was still being developed, so we agreed to go with a fairly simple site design that would reflect the higher level goal of helping people live more sustainably.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h2>Stories magazine</h2>
                <p>An online and printed magazine for people working on the web in Local Government. I designed and customised the Wordpress site, and managed the production of the printed version for the first issue.</p>
                <a class="img" href="/images/portfolio/stories.jpg"><img src="/images/portfolio/stories-thumb.png"></a>
                <p><em>I'm no longer involved in producing the magazine or <a href="http://stories.lgwebnetwork.org/2009/09/stories-issue-1-august-2009/">the website</a> though it's close to the original version, apart from the bits that have now broken!</em></p>

        <p>Being your own client is hard. To get past staring at a blank screen I took a strategic approach like I usually would on projects at work. I allowed myself just one weekend to design and build it so it is essentially the MVP version of my own website.</p>
