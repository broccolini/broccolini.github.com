        <p>Learning to code is a journey, and the first milestone for designers is often learning HTML and CSS. A great style guide can really propel a designer on their journey to becoming a key contributor.
        The same attributes that make a style guides great for designing in the browser also help with CSS maintainability, scalability, performance, and can even make it enjoyable to work with CSS again. This talk delves into what makes a great style guide for designers and everyone else, with some tips on the process of building style guides.</p>

        <p>I've learned a lot about the hard and soft skills you need to build style guides from my experiences at Etsy and GitHub. This doesn't cover all the things I know, but this quick and fun lightning talk covers some of the most useful and practical things I've learned over the years.</p>

        <p class=""><a class="secondary-link" title="Design Driven NYC website" href="http://designdrivennyc.com">Design Driven NYC</a>, November 2014</p>
          <p>In early 2014 the Seller Services team at Etsy began work on building better shop management tools for sellers; one of the goals being to improve the mobile web experience. The existing Etsy style guide did not lend itself well to responsive layouts, styles had become outdated, documentation was missing, and designers and developers often had to write a lot of CSS for experiments and new features.</p>
          <p>As part of the shop tools project, myself and 3 fellow designers embarked on building a new "living" style guide. This talk covers some of the lessons we learned along the way.</p>

        <p>Designing for people is at the heart of my design process, as is collaboration with my coworkers. At Etsy designers are informed by user research and analytics, and work closely with engineers and product managers to build the right experience for our audience.</p>
        <p>This talk covers how people-centric design and team collaboration are at the core of how we design and build Etsy.</p>
