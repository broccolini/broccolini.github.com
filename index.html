    <p><strong>Hello, I'm Diana Mounter</strong> (AKA broccolini).</p>
    <p>I'm a user experience designer.</p>
    <p>I sketch designs, architecture and workflows for websites and applications; design and facilitate workshops with stakeholders; plan and conduct research into user needs (so that we have a better chance of building the right thing); and take an agile approach when it comes to the production phase of projects.</p>
      <p>I like working on/with sustainability, social, data viz, innovative and experimental projects.</p>
    <p>I am currently an Experience Architect at <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net">Digital Eskimo</a> which fills up the majority of my time, though I will do the odd side project if it interests me, is for a valuable cause, or allows me to stretch my skills.</p>

    <li><a href="http://bouncr.com">Bouncr</a> - an application for shortening email addresses: The application was a <a href="http://startupbus.com">StartupBus</a> finalist and winner of the San Francisco bus. I worked on the user experience design and information architecture, and assisted with agile project management.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www2.acfonline.org.au/">ACF GreenHome:</a> Greenhome seeks to engage with and educate communities about environmental issues within the household context. I worked on the user experience strategy and interface design together with my colleagues at Digital Eskimo. The project taught me a lot about behaviour change in the online context, designing iteratively, and working with a distributed team.</li>
    <li><a href="http://hothouselaunch.unsw.edu.au">HotHouse</a> - blog, event website, and interactive installation: Producer and experience architect for online experience and production of an interactive digital installation to engage designers with an event experience that continued online.</li>
    <li><a href="http://sustainability.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW Sustainability:</a> A website that pulls in electricity meter readings from the UNSW campus. A small project that I hope grows to make a big impact and be part of embedding the culture of sustainable living in every aspect of UNSW.</li>
    <li><a href="http://culturalawards2009.lgsa.org.au/">LGSA Cultural Awards 2009:</a> A user-generated-content site to promote local government cultural projects. It was a great experience to see the diversity of cultural projects developed in partnership with Local Government and artists and creative people in the community. The best thing about the project was seeing the videos of stories from people in the community, how they benefited from the projects and their fascinating stories.</li>
    <li><a href="http://stories.lgwebnetwork.org/2009/09/stories-issue-1-august-2009/">LG Web Network Stories Magazine</a> An online and printed magazine for a community of people working on the web in Local Government.
