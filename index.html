    <p><strong>Hello, I'm Diana Mounter</strong> (AKA broccolini).</p>
    <p>I'm a user interface and user experience designer.</p>
    <p>I sketch designs, architecture and workflows for websites and applications; design and facilitate workshops with stakeholders; plan and conduct research into user needs (so that we have a better chance of building the right thing); and take an agile approach when it comes to the production phase of projects.</p>
      <p>I like working on/with sustainability, social, data viz, innovative and experimental projects.</p>
    <p>I am currently an Experience Architect at <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net">Digital Eskimo</a> which fills up the majority of my time, though I will do the odd side project if it interests me, is for a valuable cause, or allows me to stretch my skills.</p>

  <h1>prominent projects</h1>
  <ul class="posts">
    <li><a href="http://www2.acfonline.org.au/">ACF GreenHome:</a> <strong>Greenhome seeks to engage with and educate communities about environmental issues within the household context.</strong> I worked on the user experience strategy and interface design together with my colleagues at Digital Eskimo. The project taught me a lot about behaviour change in the online context, designing iteratively, and working with a distributed team.</li>
    <li><a href="http://reduceyourfootprint.com.au/">Reduce Your Footprint:</a> <strong>A site for residents of the Sydney eastern suburbs to help reduce the areas ecological footprint.</strong> We took and agile approach to the production phase which showed me how releasing early and often supported the participatory design approach we'd carried out through the scoping phase.</li>
    <li><a href="http://sustainability.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW Sustainability:</a> <strong>A website that pulls in electricity meter readings from the UNSW campus.</strong> A small project that I hope grows to make a big impact and be part of embedding the culture of sustainable living in every aspect of UNSW.</li>
    <li><a href="http://culturalawards2009.lgsa.org.au/">LGSA Cultural Awards 2009:</a> <strong>A user-generated-content site to promote local government cultural projects.</strong> It was a great experience to see the diversity of cultural projects developed in partnership with Local Government and artists and creative people in the community. The best thing about the project was seeing the videos of stories from people in the community, how they benefited from the projects and their fascinating stories.</li>
    <li><a href="http://stories.lgwebnetwork.org/2009/09/stories-issue-1-august-2009/">LG Web Network Stories Magazine</a> <strong>An online and printed magazine for a community of people working on the web in Local Government.</strong> I produced and built the Wordpress site and printed version for the first issue. I realised quickly I'd taken on more work than I'd anticipated, but it turned out to be a really enjoyable and highly rewarding experience. I knew it was worth it when I walked into the conference to see people engrossed in reading the magazine.</li>
