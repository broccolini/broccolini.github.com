    <p><strong>Hello, I'm Diana Mounter</strong> (AKA broccolini).</p>
    <p>I'm a user interface and user experience designer.</p>
    <p>I sketch designs, architecture and workflows for websites and applications; design and facilitate workshops with stakeholders; plan and conduct research into user needs (so that we have a better chance of building the right thing); and take an agile approach when it comes to the production phase of projects.</p>
      <p>I like working on/with sustainability, social, data viz, innovative and experimental projects.</p>
    <p>I am currently an Experience Architect at <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net">Digital Eskimo</a> which fills up the majority of my time, though I will do the odd side project if it interests me, is for a valuable cause, or allows me to stretch my skills.</p>
