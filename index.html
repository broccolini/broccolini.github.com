          <!-- <p>Keeping design and code consistent across a product is challenging, especially on a site that has grown to serve over 1 million users and is over 7 years old.</p> -->
          <p>In early 2014 the Seller Services team at Etsy began work on building better shop management tools for sellers; one of the goals being to improve the mobile web experience. The existing Etsy style guide did not lend itself well to responsive layouts, styles had become outdated, documentation was missing, and designers and developers often had to write a lot of CSS for experiments and new features.</p>
          <p>As part of the shop tools project, myself and 3 fellow designers embarked on building a new "living" style guide. This talk covers some of the lessons we learned along the way.</p>

        <p>Designing for people is at the heart of my design process, as is collaboration with my coworkers. At Etsy designers are informed by user research and analytics, and work closely with engineers and product managers to build the right experience for our audience.</p>
        <p>This talk covers how people-centric design and team collaboration are at the core of how we design and build Etsy.</p>

      <p class=""><a class="secondary-link" title="Asbury Agile conference website" href="http://www.asburyagile.com/">Asbury Agile</a>, October 2014</p>
      <p>One of the hardest things to get right in any company is building a healthy work environment, and maintaining it as a company grows and faces new challenges. As a product designer and project manager I've often found myself in the position of the facilitator — encouraging team collaboration and helping keep that collaboration. This means adapting as change happens, and evolving a process that helps us recognize when change is needed. At Etsy this doesn't just mean retrospectives, it filters into many aspects of our workflow.</p>
      <p>This talk covers what's important to building and maintaining a healthy product work environment.</p>

      <p>Design is about solving problems, and it can feel daunting when you're at the start of unravelling those problems. Defining goals, use cases, and principles can help you make sense of the mess.</p>

      <p>This talk gives an introduction to product design with tips and tricks for aspiring Ruby on Rails programmers.</p>

        <p>Learning the Scrum framework gave me some great tools in my role as a project manager. I was so inspired by what I learned that I started thinking Scrum was the right way to solve every problem. It wasn't.</p>
        <p>This talk gives an honest and humorous reflection of how I learned some hard lessons after taking the ScrumMaster certification.</p>
