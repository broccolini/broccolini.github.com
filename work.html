  <p><strong>Hello, I'm Diana Mounter.</strong></p>
  <p>I design user experiences and help teams build them. My approach is influenced by human-centric design, agile development, the people I work with, and the lessons I learn from each project.</p>

  <h1 class="mywork">Projects</h1>
  <p>My role on a project usually starts from the scoping and research phase, using insights to develop concepts, and then developing those into interface specifications. As a user experience designer and producer I continue to work closely with teams throughout the production phase, developing branding and design 'look and feel', exploring implementation options for features, continuing to test what we build so that it informs the development of the final product.</p>
    <ul class="projects">  
    <li><span><h3><a href="/projects/virtual-learning-environment.html">Virtual Learning Environment</a></h3>I was the producer and developed the user experience strategy interaction design for an online learning tool. We were asked to develop a prototype though the first version was used for a real course by students in the Asia Pacific.</span><a href="/projects/virtual-learning-environment.html"><img src="/images/portfolio/vle-home1.jpg"></a></li>
    <!-- <li><span><h3><a href="#">GreenHome website</a></h3>Lorizzle the bizzle dolor rizzle amizzle, own yo' adipiscing shit.

Sed erizzle.</span><img src="/images/portfolio/gh-home.jpg"></li> -->
    <li><span><h3><a href="/projects/urban-sketch-lab.html">Urban Sketch Lab</a></h3>I was the producer and experience architect for developing an interactive installation and accompanying event website and blog. This project taught me a lot about designing interactions for use during and after events.</span><a href="/projects/urban-sketch-lab.html"><img src="/images/portfolio/USL-prototype.jpg"></a></li>
    <li><span><h3><a href="/projects/designing-broccolini.html">Designing broccolini.net</a></h3>Being your own client is hard. To get past staring at a blank screen I took a strategic approach like I usually would on projects at work. I allowed myself just one weekend to design and build it so it is essentially the MVP version of my own website.</span><a href="/projects/designing-broccolini.html"><img src="/images/portfolio/fighters-sketch.jpg"></a></li>
